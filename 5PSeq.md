This protocol is used to generate 5P-Seq sequencing libraries by enriching for mRNA species containing a 5' Phosphate group, which is a sign of 5' exonucleolytic cleavage by Xrn1. This protocol can also be used to quickly generate mRNA-Seq libraries without using gels, by using purely a magnetic (SPRI bead) based purification.<sup>1</sup>
