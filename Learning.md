***Introduction to Focused and Diffuse Modes***

* Two fundamentally different modes of thinking: focused and diffused
  * Focused thinking: Concentrate intently on a problem
   * Careful, patterned thinking about problems you've already got some handle on
  * Diffused thinking: Relaxed thinking more related to neural resting states
   * Broad ideas that do not focus on the details allowing for easier understanding of new concepts
